Reverse-engineering some c64 demo effects

## description

This is a repo containing save states and notes for various c64 demo effects that I'm reverse-engineering. I'm primarily using [VICE](http://vice-emu.sourceforge.net/)'s monitor to dig around and change stuff to see what happens. Not much here yet, but figured as I wanted to back up the notes I was taking, why not make them public as well? :)
